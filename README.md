# Music-Player-with-react
Simple music player using Spotify Web Api

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### React Project: Spotify Music Player

Overview:
The Spotify Music Player project is a React-based application that allows users to access and play short audio music which is provided by artist in their music albums from the Spotify API. With this API, I have made a Spotify music player with the customized styles

Key Features:

1. User Authentication:
   - Implements secure user authentication using the Spotify API to allow users to log in with their Spotify credentials.

2. Playlist Management:
   - Enables users to view and manage their Spotify playlists within the application.

3. Real-Time Data Updates:
   - Utilizes real-time updates from the Spotify API to reflect changes in the user's Spotify account dynamically.

4. Pick and Play:
   - Implements a functionality which we are open to select to play any album's music, enabling users to discover and play tracks directly from the Spotify library.

5. Responsive Design:
   - The UI part of this project and the smoothness of the application is the main highlight of this project. This design is the customization within my creativity and turned out well.

6. Playback Controls:
   - Integrates playback controls such as play, pause, play previous song and play after song for a seamless user experience.
